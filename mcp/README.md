# MCP Server

Python MCP server that bridges the STS2 mod's HTTP API to 70+ MCP tools for AI agents.

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

```bash
uv run --directory mcp python server.py
```

## Displayer Integration

The MCP server forwards every tool call to the [displayer dashboard](../displayer/) for live narration. This is automatic when the displayer is running on `localhost:15580`. Use `--no-displayer` to disable.
